1. Create an object that describes a car (manufacturer, model, year of release, average speed) and the following methods for working with this object:
    A method that displays the car info 
    A method for counting a time frame necessary to cover a given distance with the average speed. Note that every 4 hours the driver has to take a 1-hour break.
    
2. Create an object that contains separately the numerator and the denominator of a fraction, and the following functions for working with this object:
    A function for adding two fraction objects.
    A function for subtracting two fraction objects.
    A function for multiplying two fraction objects.
    A function for dividing two fraction objects.
    A function for simplifying a fraction object. 
    
3. Create an object that describes time (hours, minutes, seconds), and the following methods for working with this object: 
    A method for displaying the time. 
    A method for changing the time by a given amount of seconds. 
    A method for changing the time by a given amount of minutes.  
    A method for changing the time by a given amount of hours. 
  Note that in the last three methods changing one part may influence another. For example, if we add 30 seconds to «20:30:45», we should get «20:31:15», not «20:30:75».
